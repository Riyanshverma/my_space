This is going to be a complete tuitorial for Git:
    1. Local refers to the current working directory that is present on the laptop.

    2. Remote refers to the files and folders that are present on the Github.

    3. Clone:- Means copying the repository from remote server (Github) to local system.
        git clone "project link"

    4. Status:- Tells the status of the code on which we are working right now.
        git status
    
    5. Add:- This adds new chnages to the working directory so that git can track the changes.
        git add "filename"
        git add .(enables to add all the files)
    
    6. Commit:- This is used to finalize the changes that are made on the files.
        git commit -m "Some message"

    7. Push:- It is used to push all the changes that are made in the files to the Github.
        git push origin main
    
    8. Init:- It is used to initialize the git in your project folder.
        git init

    9. Remote Add Origin:- It used to add a new repository on Github. 
        git remote add origin "https://github.com/username/repo.git"
    
    10. Remote -v:-  Tells which repository are we currently working on.

    11. Branch:- Refers to the copies that are created by different developers at the same time.

    12. To rename any branch name we use git branch -M "name"

    13. Setting upstream means that if we are working on a project for a long time then we can set origin main as -u to
        make it easy while pushing some thing on Github.
